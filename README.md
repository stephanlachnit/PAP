# Scripts for PAP at University Heidelberg

Some older ones, especially from PAP1, might not work.
You can take a look at 'measure.py' to get the replacement functions.
Scripts with a given measure can use that version, check git history to get the old version of 'measure.py', each version of 'measure.py' is tagged.
